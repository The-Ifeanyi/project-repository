    "Ginika runs the biggest shipping company in Southern Nigeria, Ginika's Shippers. Ginika wants to make sure that every single one of her customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages. In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Ginika’s Shippers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ginika’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package. They have ground shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package. Premium ground shipping, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight. They recently also implemented drone shipping, which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.\n",
